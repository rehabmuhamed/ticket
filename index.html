        <h2>Equality = Sameness</h2>
        <p>
          Equality means providing the same opportunities and resources to all
          individuals, regardless of their background or circumstances.<br />
          It aims to treat everyone equally and promote justice. <br />
          However, it may not address the unique needs and challenges that some
          individuals face.

        <h2>Equaity=Fairness</h2>
        <p>
          Equity means ensuring that everyone gets what they need to have an
          equal chance at success. <br />
          It takes into account the diverse backgrounds and challenges
          individuals may have.<br />
          By providing additional support and resources to those who require
          them,<br />
          equity promotes fairness and equal outcomes.

        <h2>Example :</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine a school that practices equality. <br />
          It provides the same textbooks, facilities, and teachers to all
          students.<br />
          However, some students may have learning disabilities or come from
          disadvantaged backgrounds, <br />
          making it difficult for them to succeed with only equal resources.
          <br />
          On the other hand, a school that practices equity would provide
          additional resources such as tutoring or individualized support to
          students who need it,<br />
          ensuring that all students have an equal opportunity to thrive
          academically.
